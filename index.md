# About
The Skunkworks were setup in order to separate the commercial side of the company from the development side. This aims to strike a balance between documenting nothing publicly until a product is ready to go, and cluttering the main Northern Widget LLC spaces with prototype designs which may never turn into a product, or may not for some time.

Some of the Skunkworks branded devices are for sale over at [Northern Widget LLC](http://www.northernwidget.com/), however, they are considered in development and may or may not continue to be supported. But don't forget, supporting Skunkworks projects helps us continue to make new and cool things, so please keep it up!
